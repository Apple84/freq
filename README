INSTALLATION:

sudo cp bin/freq.pl /usr/bin/freq

PURPOSE: 

I do a lot of command line parsing on a daily basis. As such, I find myself
doing a lot of quick evaluations based on transient flat files of data. Given a
stream of lines from a file (e.g., cat or STDOUT from a process), this script
will create a frequency report of how many times each unique line is
encountered. That's all it does.

USAGE:

freq ----------------------------------------------------------------

 USAGE: cat <file> | freq -sort [ascending|descending] --verbose

   -sort       Change order of frequency reporting.
               [ascending|descending]
  --verbose    Full report, includes stats. [OPTIONAL]
  --help       View option info.
  --version    Display colinfo version.

 default: freq -sort=descending
